Breakout is an arcade game.
The upper third of the game screen is occupied by rows of bars.
A ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the top and side borders of the screen.
When it hits the racket, the ball bounces off and the bar disappears.
The player loses one life when the ball hits the bottom of the screen;
to prevent this, the player has a movable racket with which the ball can be thrown back to the top of the screen.
